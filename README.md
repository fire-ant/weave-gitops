Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing
Kubernetes expertise. Experience how easy it is to enable GitOps and run your apps in a cluster. Use git to collaborate
with team members making new deployments easy and secure. Start with what developers need to run apps, and then easily
extend to define and run your own enterprise platform.

From Kubernetes run Weave GitOps to get:

1. Application Operations: manage and automate deployment pipelines for apps and more
2. Platforms: the easy way to have your own custom PaaS on cloud or on premise
3. Extensions: coordinate Kubernetes rollouts with eg. VMs, DBs and cloud services

Our vision is that all cloud native applications should be easy for developers, including operations which should be
automated and secure. Weave GitOps is a highly extensible tool to achieve this by placing Kubernetes and GitOps at the
core and building a platform around that.

We use GitOps tools throughout. Today Weave GitOps defaults are Flux, Kustomize, Helm, Sops and Kubernetes CAPI. If you
use Flux already then you can easily add Weave GitOps to create a platform management overlay.

### Manage and view applications all in one place.

### Easily see your continuous deployments and what is being produced via GitOps. There are multiple views for debugging as well as being able to sync your latest git commits directly from the UI.

### Leverage Kubernetes RBAC to control permissions in the dashboard.

### See your entire source landscape whether it is a git repository, helm repository, or bucket.

### Quickly see the health of your reconciliation deployment runtime. These are the workers that are ensuring your software is running on the Kubernetes cluster.
