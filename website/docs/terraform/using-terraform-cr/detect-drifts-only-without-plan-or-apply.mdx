# Use TF-controller to detect drifts only without planning or applying

To detect drifts of your Terraform resources only, you can use the `Terraform` custom resource (CR) object
in TF-controller and set the `spec.approvePlan` field to `disable`. This will tell the controller to skip
the plan and apply stages, and only perform drift detection.

Here is an example of a `Terraform` CR object with `spec.approvePlan` set to `disable`:

```yaml {7}
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: disable
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
```
