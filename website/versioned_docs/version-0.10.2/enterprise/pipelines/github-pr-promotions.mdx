# Promoting apps through pipeline environments <TierLabel tiers="enterprise" />

Pipelines allow you to configure automatic promotions of applications through a consecutive set of environments, e.g. from dev to staging to production. The environments are defined in the `Pipeline` resource itself so that each pipeline governs a single application and all the environments to which it is deployed.

:::note
At the moment only applications defined as Flux `HelmReleases` are supported in automatic promotions.

![an example promotion PR](img/promotion-pr.png)

The [Getting started guide](../getting-started) describes how to create a basic pipeline for an application so you can visualize its deployments across a series of environments. 
This document will cover adding a promotion by pull request (PR) strategy, so that whenever the application defined in a pipeline is upgraded in one of the pipeline's environments, a GitHub PR is created that updates the manifest file setting the app version in the next environment.

The dynamic nature of GitOps deployments requires you to assist Weave GitOps a little with information on which repository hosts the manifest files, how to authenticate with the repository and the GitHub API, and which file hosts the version definition for each environment.

## Ensure promotion webhook is reachable from leaf clusters

Promotions are triggered by leaf clusters reaching out to Weave GitOps running on the management cluster. Make sure that the `pipeline-controller-promotion` Service is properly exposed, e.g. by an Ingress resource. You will need the externally reachable URL of this service later on in this guide.

## Create credentials secret

In order to authenticate with the GitHub repository hosting the manifests, you need to create a Secret with credentials used for cloning. The contents of this secret are the same you use for [GitRepositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/#secret-reference). In addition to these you need to include a `token` field containing a GitHub access token that is used to authenticate with the GitHub API when creating a pull request. Here is an example Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: promotion-credentials
  namespace: pipeline-01
data:
  username: ZXhhbXBsZQ==
  password: ZXhhbXBsZS1wYXNzd29yZA==
  token: Z2hwX01IL3RsTFpXTXZMY0FxVWRYY1ZGL0lGbzh0WDdHNjdsZmRxWQ==
type: Opaque
```

:::note
The GitHub token provided in the `token` field needs to be given permission to create pull requests in the pipeline's repository (defined in `.spec.promotion.pull-request.url`).
:::

:::caution
The Secret needs to reside in the same Namespace as the Pipeline resource on the management cluster.
:::

## Define promotion in pipeline resource

The field `.spec.promotion.pull-request` defines details about the Git repository used for promoting the given app. Set the `secretRef.name` field to the name of the Secret created in the previous step and the `url` and `branch` fields to the Git repository's URL and optionally a specific branch (if the branch is not set, it defaults to `main`).

## Add markers to app manifests

The discovery of the version field is done using deterministic markers in a YAML manifest file. An example `HelmRelease` manifest with such a marker looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      version: 0.13.7 # {"$promotion": "pipeline-01:my-app:prod"}
[...]
```

The value of the `$promotion` field in the comment is comprised of 3 components separated by colons:

1. The first field is the Namespace of the pipeline resource that the app is part of. In the example above this is `pipeline-01`.
1. The second field denotes the name of the pipeline resource.
1. The third field is the name of the environment that this specific HelmRelease targets. The environment name in the marker needs to match with the `name` field of one of the environments defined in the pipeline's `.spec.environments` array.

Weave GitOps will look for this marker whenever it receives an event from the respective HelmRelease of one of the leaf clusters and patch the file with the version denoted in the event (see below for how an event is triggered and what it looks like).

## Create notification resources on leaf clusters

Promotion events are triggered by Flux's [notification controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/). You create a Provider pointing to Weave Gitops' promotion webhook and an Alert targeting the app's HelmRelease:

```yaml
   apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
   kind: Provider
   metadata:
     name: promotion-my-app
   spec:
     address: "https://pipeline-promotion.example.org/pipeline-01/my-app/dev"
     type: generic
[...]
```

The `address` field's URL path is comprised of 3 components again:

1. The Namespace of the app's pipeline.
1. The name of the pipeline resource.
1. The origin environment's name. This is the name of the environment that the event is created in, e.g. "dev" for events coming from the "dev" environment.

Weave GitOps can then identify the pipeline resource and look up the next environment based on the URL it received the event at.

An example Alert might look like this:

```yaml
   apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
   kind: Alert
   [...]
   spec:
     eventSeverity: info
     eventSources:
     - kind: HelmRelease
       name: my-app
     exclusionList:
     - .*upgrade.*has.*started
     - .*is.*not.*ready
     - ^Dependencies.*
     providerRef:
       name: promotion-my-app
```

:::note
Be aware to create the Provider/Alert tuple on each of the leaf clusters targeted by a pipeline.
:::

Now as soon as the `HelmRelease` on the first environment defined in the pipeline is bumped (e.g. by Flux discovering a new version in the Helm repository), an event is sent to the Weave GitOps promotion webhook which in turn will clone the repository, patch the manifest file based on the matching marker YAML comment and create a GitHub PR.
