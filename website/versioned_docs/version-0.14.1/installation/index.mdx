## Installing Weave GitOps

### Pre-requisites

#### Kubernetes Cluster

No matter which version of Weave GitOps you install, having a Kubernetes cluster up
and running is required. This version of Weave GitOps is tested against the following
[Kubernetes releases](https://kubernetes.io/releases/):

| Kubernetes Release | End of Life |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1.25               | 2023-10-27  |
| 1.24               | 2023-07-28  |
| 1.23               | 2023-02-28  |
| 1.22               | 2022-10-28  |

Note that the version of [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#prerequisites) that you use might impose further minimum version requirements.
