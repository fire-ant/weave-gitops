## Installing Weave GitOps

### Before you begin

We will provide a complete walk-through of getting Flux installed and Weave GitOps configured. However, if you have:
- an existing cluster bootstrapped Flux version >= 0.32.0 üéâ
- followed our [installation](./index.mdx) doc to configure access to the Weave GitOps dashboard then install Weave GitOps üëè

Then you can skip ahead to [the Weave GitOps overview](../getting-started.mdx#part-1---weave-gitops-overview) üèÉ
but note ‚ö†Ô∏è you may need to alter commands where we are committing files to GitHub ‚ö†Ô∏è.

To follow along, you will need the following:
- A Kubernetes cluster - such as [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account and [personal access token with repo permissions](https://help.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

#### Install Flux

Weave GitOps is an extension to Flux and therefore requires that Flux 0.32 or later has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster. Full documentation is available at: [https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/).

This version of Weave GitOps is tested against the following Flux releases:
* 0.32
* 0.33
* 0.34
* 0.35
* 0.36

1. Install the flux CLI

   ```
   brew install fluxcd/tap/flux
   ```

   For other installation methods, see the relevant [Flux documentation](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#install-the-flux-cli).

1. Export your credentials

   ```
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
   export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
   ```

1. Check your Kubernetes cluster

   ```
   flux check --pre
   ```

   The output is similar to:
   ```
   ‚ñ∫ checking prerequisites
   ‚úî kubernetes 1.22.2 >=1.20.6
   ‚úî prerequisites checks passed
   ```

1. Install Flux onto your cluster with the `flux bootstrap` command

   ```
   flux bootstrap github \
     --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
     --repository=fleet-infra \
     --branch=main \
     --path=./clusters/my-cluster \
     --personal
   ```

Full installation documentation including how to work with other Git providers is available [here](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/).

The bootstrap command above does the following:

- Create a git repository fleet-infra on your GitHub account
- Add Flux component manifests to the repository
- Deploy Flux Components to your Kubernetes Cluster
- Configure Flux components to track the path /clusters/my-cluster/ in the repository

### Install Weave GitOps

For this guide we will use the cluster user, for complete documentation including how to configure an OIDC provider see the documentation [here](../configuration/securing-access-to-the-dashboard.mdx).

#### gitops CLI

Weave GitOps includes a command-line interface to help users create and manage resources.

:::note Installation options
The `gitops` CLI is currently supported on Mac (x86 and Arm), and Linux - including Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Windows support is a [planned enhancement](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues/663).
:::

There are multiple ways to install the `gitops` CLI:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="installation" default>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/releases/download/v0.16.0/gitops-$(uname)-$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/gitops /usr/local/bin
gitops version
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew">

```console
brew tap weaveworks/tap
brew install weaveworks/tap/gitops
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deploying Weave GitOps

1. Clone your git repository where Flux has been bootstrapped.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER/fleet-infra
   cd fleet-infra
   ```

1. Run the following command which will create a `HelmRepository` and `HelmRelease` to deploy Weave GitOps

   ```
   PASSWORD="<your password>"
   gitops create dashboard ww-gitops \
     --password=$PASSWORD \
     --export > ./clusters/my-cluster/weave-gitops-dashboard.yaml
   ```

:::warning
This command stores a hash of a password.  While this is relatively safe for demo and testing purposes it is recommend that you look at more secure methods of storing secrets (such as [Flux's SOPS integration](https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/mozilla-sops/)) for production systems.

More guidance and alternative login methods can be found in [Securing access to the dashboard](../../configuration/securing-access-to-the-dashboard).
:::

1. Commit and push the `weave-gitops-dashboard.yaml` to the `fleet-infra` repository

   ```
   git add -A && git commit -m "Add Weave GitOps Dashboard"
   git push
   ```

1. Validate that Weave GitOps and Flux are installed

   ```
   kubectl get pods -n flux-system
   ```

   You should see something similar to:

   ```
   NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   helm-controller-5bfd65cd5f-gj5sz           1/1     Running   0          10m
   kustomize-controller-6f44c8d499-s425n      1/1     Running   0          10m
   notification-controller-844df5f694-2pfcs   1/1     Running   0          10m
   source-controller-6b6c7bc4bb-ng96p         1/1     Running   0          10m
   ww-gitops-weave-gitops-86b645c9c6-k9ftg    1/1     Running   0          5m
   ```

:::info
There's many other things you can configure in the weave gitops helm chart. For a reference, see [our value file reference](../references/helm-reference.md).

## Next steps

In our following [Get Started document](../getting-started.mdx), we will walk you through logging into the GitOps Dashboard and deploying an application.
