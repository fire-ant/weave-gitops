# Use TF-controller with drift detection disabled

To disable drift detection in a `Terraform` object reconciled by the TF-controller, you can add the following configuration to your `Terraform` object:

```yaml {8}
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: auto
  disableDriftDetection: true
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
```

This configuration will tell the TF-controller to run the specified Terraform configuration
located at `./` in the `flux-system` namespace, with a polling `interval` of 1 minute.
It will also automatically approve any plans that are created,
and it will not perform drift detection.

Drift detection is a feature that compares the current state of the resources
managed by Terraform with the desired state defined in the configuration files.
If there are any differences, the TF-controller will create a plan to bring
the resources back in line with the configuration.
By setting `spec.disableDriftDetection: true`, you are telling the TF-controller
to skip this check and not create any plans to correct for any detected drift.
