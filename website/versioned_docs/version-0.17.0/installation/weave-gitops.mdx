## Installing Weave GitOps on your Cluster

:::tip
These are the instructions to install the OSS tier Weave GitOps. To install Enterprise
Weave GitOps, follow the instructions [here][ee-install].
:::

### Before you begin

To follow along, you will need the following:
- A Kubernetes cluster - such as [Kind][kind]
- A [GitHub][github] account and [personal access token with repo permissions][pat]
- [kubectl][kubectl]

### Install Flux

Weave GitOps is an extension to Flux and therefore requires that Flux 0.32 or
later has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster. Full documentation
is available [here][fl-install].

This version of Weave GitOps is tested against the following Flux releases:
* 0.36
* 0.35
* 0.34
* 0.33
* 0.32

In this section we are going to do the following:

- Create a git repository `fleet-infra` in your Git account
- Add Flux component manifests to the repository
- Deploy Flux Components to your Kubernetes Cluster
- Configure Flux components to track the path `./clusters/my-cluster/` in the repository

Let's get into it... :sparkles:

1. Install the flux CLI

   ```
   brew install fluxcd/tap/flux
   ```

   For other installation methods, see the relevant [Flux documentation][fl-install].

1. Export your credentials (ensure your PAT has `repo` scope)

   ```
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
   export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
   ```

1. Check your Kubernetes cluster

   ```
   flux check --pre
   ```

   The output is similar to:
   ```
   ► checking prerequisites
   ✔ kubernetes 1.22.2 >=1.20.6
   ✔ prerequisites checks passed
   ```

1. Install Flux onto your cluster with the `flux bootstrap` command. The command
	below assumes the Git provider to be `github`, alter this if you would rather use
	`gitlab`.

   ```
   flux bootstrap github \
     --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
     --repository=fleet-infra \
     --branch=main \
     --path=./clusters/my-cluster \
     --personal
   ```

	:::info
	Full installation documentation including how to work with other Git providers is available [here][fl-install].
	:::

1. If you navigate to your Git provider, you will see that the `fleet-infra`
	repository has been created.

### Install the `gitops` CLI

Weave GitOps includes a command-line interface to help users create and manage resources.

:::note Installation options
The `gitops` CLI is currently supported on Mac (x86 and Arm), and Linux - including Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Windows support is a [planned enhancement](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues/663).
:::

There are multiple ways to install the `gitops` CLI:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="installation" default>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/releases/download/v0.17.0/gitops-$(uname)-$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/gitops /usr/local/bin
gitops version
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew">

```console
brew tap weaveworks/tap
brew install weaveworks/tap/gitops
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deploy Weave GitOps

In this section we will do the following:

- Use the GitOps CLI tool to generate [`HelmRelease`][helm-rel] and [`HelmRepository`][helm-repo] objects.
- Create some login credentials to access the dashboard. This is a simple but **insecure**
  method of protecting and accessing your GitOps dashboard.
- Commit the generated yamls to our `fleet-infra` repo.
- Observe as they are synced to the cluster.

1. Clone your git repository where Flux has been bootstrapped.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER/fleet-infra
   cd fleet-infra
   ```

1. Run the following command which will create a `HelmRepository` and `HelmRelease` to deploy Weave GitOps

   ```
   PASSWORD="<your password>"
   gitops create dashboard ww-gitops \
     --password=$PASSWORD \
     --export > ./clusters/my-cluster/weave-gitops-dashboard.yaml
   ```

	:::warning
	This command stores a hash of a password.  While this is relatively safe for demo
	and testing purposes it is recommend that you look at more secure methods of storing secrets
	(such as [Flux's SOPS integration][sops]) for production systems.

	More guidance and alternative login methods can be found in [Securing access to the dashboard][dash-access].
	:::

1. Commit and push the `weave-gitops-dashboard.yaml` to the `fleet-infra` repository

   ```
   git add -A && git commit -m "Add Weave GitOps Dashboard"
   git push
   ```

1. Validate that Weave GitOps and Flux are installed. _Note: this wont be instantaneous,
	give the Flux controllers a couple of minutes to pull the latest commit._

   ```
   kubectl get pods -n flux-system
   ```

   You should see something similar to:

   ```
   NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   helm-controller-5bfd65cd5f-gj5sz           1/1     Running   0          10m
   kustomize-controller-6f44c8d499-s425n      1/1     Running   0          10m
   notification-controller-844df5f694-2pfcs   1/1     Running   0          10m
   source-controller-6b6c7bc4bb-ng96p         1/1     Running   0          10m
   ww-gitops-weave-gitops-86b645c9c6-k9ftg    1/1     Running   0          5m
   ```

	:::tip
	There are many other things you can configure in the Weave GitOps Helm Chart.
	For a reference, see [our value file reference](../references/helm-reference.md).
