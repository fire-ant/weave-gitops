## Dashboard Login

There are 2 supported methods for logging in to the dashboard:
- [Login via an OIDC provider](../oidc-access)
- [Login via a cluster user account](../emergency-user) (not recommended)

The recommended method is to integrate with an OIDC provider,
as this will let you control permissions for existing users and groups that have
already been configured to use OIDC. However, it is also possible to use the Emergency Cluster
User Account to login, if an OIDC provider is not available to use.
Both methods work with standard Kubernetes RBAC.
